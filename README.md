# metro

The goal is to pass in one day by all the metro stations in Paris.
You have to go at least once (though not necessarily one) by each of the Paris metro stations intramural, during a day;
Authorized transportations are: the metro (however, the use of the bus, a car or a taxi, or even a bicycle, is prohibited).
It is not necessary to browse the metro stations located outside the limits of Paris (it stops at stations with names in "porte ... ..");
BUT it is not forbidden to leave Paris (eg. by going to the Boulogne Jean Jaurès station, which has an interest).
If a station is crossed by several lines, it is not necessary (but not prohibited) to go as many times as there are lines that pass by.
There is no need to stop at each station: cross enough.
Finally, two stations are considered different if they have different names (including Châtelet is not the same station as Les Halles).
